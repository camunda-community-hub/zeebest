## [Unreleased]
Project Abandoned.
### Postmortem
Things that went good: :tada:
- Learned a lot about Rust and Cargo 
- Experimented with cool tools: Zeebe, Protobufs
- Project vision was good

Things that went bad: :collision:
- Rust futures have been painful to work with  
- Lots of toil work in futures-runtime compatibility - zeebest should work on all runtimes
- Maintainer lost interest and works on different projects now

## [0.20.0] - 2019-09-21
Lots of big changes in this release! New futures and breaking API change.
### Changed
- the client and worker now use futures 0.3
- the worker api has been changed to return a unit future
- switch to zeebe 0.20 and change to their community license

## [0.18.1] - 2019-06-18
### Added
- A complete example app based on the [order-process workflow from Zeebe's "Getting Started Tutorial"][order_process].
- The job stream now returns the completed `ActivatedJob` struct instead of just the job key. 
### Changed
- `Sync + UnwindSafe` is now enforced on job handlers and all work is done on a threadpool with `futures-cpupool`.
- The `Client::worker` method now accepts `Duration` for timeout instead of an `i64` and there is an added assertion.
